# Security Disclaimer

## Important Warning

**Automaker uses AI-powered tooling that has access to your operating system and can read, modify, and delete files. Use at your own risk.**

## Risk Assessment

This software utilizes AI agents (such as Claude) that can:

- **Read files** from your file system
- **Write and modify files** in your projects
- **Delete files** when instructed
- **Execute commands** on your operating system
- **Access environment variables** and configuration files

While we have made efforts to review this codebase for security vulnerabilities and implement safeguards, **you assume all risk** when running this software.

## Recommendations

### 1. Review the Code First

Before running Automaker, we strongly recommend reviewing the source code yourself to understand what operations it performs and ensure you are comfortable with its behavior.

### 2. Use Sandboxing (Highly Recommended)

**We do not recommend running Automaker directly on your local computer** due to the risk of AI agents having access to your entire file system. Instead, consider:

- **Docker**: Run Automaker in a Docker container to isolate it from your host system
- **Virtual Machine**: Use a VM (such as VirtualBox, VMware, or Parallels) to create an isolated environment
- **Cloud Development Environment**: Use a cloud-based development environment that provides isolation

#### Running in Isolated Docker Container

For maximum security, run Automaker in an isolated Docker container that **cannot access your laptop's files**:

```bash
# 1. Set your API key (bash/Linux/Mac - creates UTF-8 file)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env

# On Windows PowerShell, use instead:
Set-Content -Path .env -Value "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" -Encoding UTF8

# 2. Build and run isolated container
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Access the UI at http://localhost:7007
#    API at http://localhost:7008/api/health
```

The container uses only Docker-managed volumes and has no access to your host filesystem. See [docker-isolation.md](docs/docker-isolation.md) for full documentation.

### 3. Limit Access

If you must run locally:

- Create a dedicated user account with limited permissions
- Only grant access to specific project directories
- Avoid running with administrator/root privileges
- Keep sensitive files and credentials outside of project directories

### 4. Monitor Activity

- Review the agent's actions in the output logs
- Pay attention to file modifications and command executions
- Stop the agent immediately if you notice unexpected behavior

## No Warranty & Limitation of Liability
